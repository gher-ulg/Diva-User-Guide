\chapter{Scripts, input files and directories\label{chap:general}}
%-----------------------------------------------------------

This chapter starts with the description of the scripts used by \diva, then input files required for simple 2-D analysis are presented here. 
Basically, only three files are needed as input:

\begin{enumerate}
\item a file containing the data (\file{data.dat})
\item the specification of the domain of analysis (\file{coast.cont}) and 
\item the list of the parameters used during the analysis (\file{param.par}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contour\label{contourdiva}}
%--------------------------------------

\index{Contours}
The contour file (\file{coast.cont}) delimits the region where the analysis has to be performed, i.e., it specifies the boundary between land and sea. The file is defined this way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first line indicates the number of contours ($M$) in the region of interest.
\item The second line tells the number of points ($N_{1}$) in the first contour.
\item The next $N_1$ lines are the coordinates of the points of the first contour. The convention for the contour is that \textit{the land is on the right when you follow the points successively}. The contour is automatically closed, meaning that the last point of a given contour is be from the first one. 
\item The following line is the number of points ($N_{2}$) of the second contour.
\item \ldots
\item The last $N_M$ lines are the coordinates of the points of the last contour.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exfile}[htpb]
\begin{footnotesize}
\texttt{2\\
4\\
0 0\\
100 0\\
100 80\\
0 80\\

80 40\\
80 60\\
60 60} 
\end{footnotesize}
\caption{coast.cont\label{ex:coast.dat}}
\end{exfile}

Here, the contour is made up of 2 sub-contours: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the first one with 4 points (and 4~edges): $(0,0)$, $(100,0)$, $(100,80)$ and $(0,80)$. It is the main contour.
\item the second one with also 4 points. It is the interior contour (island).
\end{itemize}
In realistic application, the contours are more complex: they have more sub-contours (islands, interior seas), and each sub-contour is made up of more points.

\end{figure}

%---------------
\subsection{Data\label{sec:dataformat}}
%----------------

\index{Data}
The data file (\file{data.dat}) contains at least three columns: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the $x-$coordinate (usually the longitude, but can also be an horizontal distance in $km$, or any coordinate).
\item the $y-$coordinate (usually the latitude).
\item the data value.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item The fourth column  [optional] indicates the weight of the each data point. If this column is empty, the fourth column is assumed to take the value $1$. 
\item If there are more than four columns, columns 5 and higher are not used by the software, except if you want to use the detrending tool (Section~\ref{sec:detrending})\index{Detrending}. 
\end{itemize}

\caption{Example of a data file and its graphical representation.}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Parameters\label{sec:param.par}}
%-------------------------------------------

\index{Parameters}
The file \file{./input/param.par} specifies the main analysis parameters and options of \diva. A clear understanding of is essential for a proper use of the software. A description of each parameter is provided below the example file.

\begin{exfile}[htpb]

\begin{verbatim}

# varbak

\end{verbatim}
%\end{footnotesize}
\caption{param.par\label{paramfile}}
\end{exfile}


\subsubsection{\texttt{Lc}}
% ------------------------

The global correlation length $L$ \index{Correlation length} used for the analysis (see Section~\ref{sec:parammeaning} for the physical meaning). It has to be defined as a real positive number. Note that the length of the finite-elements will be computed according to the value of $L$.

\subsubsection{\texttt{icoordchange}\label{sec:icoord}}
%---------------------------------------------------


Specifies the desired type of coordinate system:\\

\texttt{icoordchange} \begin{minipage}[t]{.7\textwidth} = $0$ if no change is necessary (data position in kilometres);\\
                                                        = $1$ if data positions are given in degrees;\\
                                                        = $2$ if data positions are given in degrees and your domain extends on a wide span of latitude                                                           (uses a cosine projection);\\
                                                        = $-xscale$ to scale $x$ coordinates by a factor $xscale$ before doing anything (for vertical sections: see Section~\ref{sec:cruise})
                      \end{minipage}
                      
                      
\subsubsection{\texttt{ispec}}
%--------------------------

Four base-values specify the required error outputs:\\

\texttt{ispec}       = 0\qquad: no error field requested\\
\hphantom{\texttt{ispec}}  = 1\qquad: gridded error field specified by \texttt{xori}, \texttt{yori}, \texttt{nx} and \texttt{ny}; \\
\hphantom{\texttt{ispec}}  = 2\qquad: errors at data locations;\\
\hphantom{\texttt{ispec}}  = 4\qquad: errors at locations listed in \file{valatxy.coord}.

Then you can combine these four values to obtain several error outputs: \index{Error}

\examples\\
\texttt{ispec}             = 3 (=1+2)\hphantom{+4} \qquad \begin{minipage}[t]{.7\textwidth}means you want gridded error field as well as errors at data locations;\end{minipage}\\ 
\texttt{ispec}             = 7 (=1+2+4) \qquad means you want the three error files.


For computing errors with the real covariance function (Section~\ref{sec:realcovariance}), simply multiply the \texttt{ispec} value by $-1$:

\example\\
\texttt{ispec}             = -7 \qquad \begin{minipage}[t]{.7\textwidth}{means you want the three error files computed with the help of the real covariance function.}\end{minipage}


A \textit{poor man's} error estimate (quick and underestimated error field, Section~\ref{sec:poormans}) is available by adding $+10$ to the \texttt{ispec} value:

\example\\
\texttt{ispec}             = 16 \qquad \begin{minipage}[t]{.7\textwidth}{means you want errors at data locations and at points listed in \file{valatxy.coord} computed with the \textit{poor man's} error estimate.}\end{minipage}

Finally, adding $+10$ and multiplying \texttt{ispec} by $-1$ means that the error field is computed using the real covariance function and taking into account the boundary effects. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{ireg}}

Specification of the background field which is subtracted from the data field (Section~\ref{sec:backgroundfield}).

\texttt{ireg}             = 0 \qquad: no background field is subtracted (assuming data are already anomalies); \\
\hphantom{\texttt{ireg}}  = 1 \qquad: the data mean value is subtracted;\\
\hphantom{\texttt{ireg}}  = 2 \qquad: the linear regression of the data (plane) is subtracted.

\subsubsection{\texttt{xori/yori, nx/ny}}

\texttt{xori/yori} indicate the coordinates of the first grid point while \texttt{nx/ny} indicate the number of grid points in \texttt{x/y} directions.



\subsubsection{\texttt{valex}}
%-----------------------------

Exclusion value: value used to fill the output matrix when a point corresponds with land. Any value is accepted, but the user has to ensure that the exclusion value cannot be a value obtained by the interpolation of the measurements. 


\subsubsection{\texttt{snr}}
%---------------------------

Signal-to-noise ratio of the whole dataset (Section~\ref{sec:formulation}). It has to be defined as a real positive number (as the correlation length).\index{Signal-to-noise ratio}

\subsubsection{\texttt{varbak}}
%------------------------------

Variance of the background field. 

\subsection[Additional points of analysis]{Locations of additional points where analysis is required (optional)}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file \file{valatxy.coord} is a two-column list of locations where you want the analysis to be performed (in addition to the regular grid defined in \file{param.par}).  

\begin{exfile}[htpb]
\begin{footnotesize}
\texttt{20 20 0\\
60 10\\
40 40} 
\end{footnotesize}
\caption{valatxy.coord\label{ex:valatxy}}
\end{exfile}

If they exist, columns 3 and higher are not used.


\section{Working directories (2-D analysis)}
% ------------------------------

For 2-D analysis, the main working directory is \directory{divastripped}. Inside it, we have:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Bash]
[charles@gher13 divastripped] tree -d -L 2
.
|-- divawork
|   `-- sub
|-- gnuwork
|   |-- gnuplottools
|   `-- plots
|-- input
|-- meshgenwork
`-- output
    |-- ghertonetcdf
    `-- meshvisu

10 directories
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{description}

\item[\directory{divawork}] is where the intermediate files are produced.
\item[\directory{gnuwork}] contains the scripts for generating the plots with Gnuplot. These plots will be located in the sub-folder \directory{plots}.
\item[\directory{input}] contains the input files presented in this section.
\item[\directory{divawork}] is the working directory for the mesh generation.
\item[\directory{output}] contains the analysis results. In \directory{ghertonetcdf}, one can find the output in NetCDF format (file \file{results.nc}), while \directory{meshvisu} stores the files that describe the mesh.
\end{description}

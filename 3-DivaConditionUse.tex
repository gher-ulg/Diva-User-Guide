\diva is a software developed at the GeoHydrodynamic and Environmental Research (GHER, \url{http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/}) group at the University of Li√®ge (\url{http://www.ulg.ac.be})) and that will be further developed for SeaDataNet scientific data products in \texttt{JRA4} activities. \diva is copyright $\copyright$  2006-2012 by the GHER group and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL): \url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html} \index{SeaDataNet}

In short, this means that everyone is free to use \diva and to redistribute it on a free basis. \diva is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its distribution (see the license \url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html} and its associated FAQ \url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html}). For example, you cannot integrate this version of \diva (in full or in parts) in any \textit{closed-source} software you plan to distribute (commercially or not).

If you want to integrate \diva into a closed-source software, or want to sell a modified closed-source version of \diva, please contact us in person. You can purchase a version of \diva under a different license, with \textit{no strings attached} (for example allowing you to take parts of \diva and integrate them into your own proprietary code).

This \diva User Guide aims to cover all the aspects of the methods: the theory (Part~\ref{part:theory}), the two-dimension version (Part~\ref{part:2Dimplementation}), the climatology production with GODIVA \index{GODIVA}(Part~\ref{part:godiva}) and the description of the scripts and the Fortran code (Part~\ref{part:appendix}). 

The user who directly wants to perform analysis shall start with Part~\ref{part:2Dimplementation}, which describes the input files and provides examples of realistic, simple runs. The \diva-demecum (Chapter~\ref{chap:divademecum}) is particularly useful to have a small summary of all the commands and options.

For more theoretical developments, the user is invited to read Part~\ref{part:theory} as well as the corresponding bibliography.

To make easier the reading of the document, different font colors are used for different type of files:
\begin{itemize}
\item \file{the files} (ascii or binary),
\item \command{the commands} (which can also be ascii files, but that are executable),
\item \directory{the directories}.
\end{itemize}
Various example files are provided for different situations.

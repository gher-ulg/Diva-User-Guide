## For the readers

This repository contains the source file (.tex) as well as the figures necessary to build the Diva User Guide in pdf.




## For the editors

1. Try to use the commands 
```
\file{}
\command{}
\directory{}
```
in order to evidence the files, command and directory names.

Example:
```latex
"Execute \command{divafit}, and you get file \file{param.par.fit} in \directory{output}"
```

2. Progressively add commands such as `\index{key-word}` to build a consistent index.

3. English: try to stick to British English
